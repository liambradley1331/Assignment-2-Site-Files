                        make a comeback. Higher costs for producers have not yet transferred to consumers.</p>

                    <p>Dole's bananas were acquired by Chiquita, worrying many. When asked which Banana they preferred,
                        one customer stated "Dole bananas are tastier and do not leave this awful residue in my mouth so
                        I only purchase Dole. If not available, I buy other fruit."</p>

                        choice in fruit of a banana. Clearly, this elephant is a higher being.</p>

                        hungry". Honestly, he's pretty real for that. The student had not eaten breakfast at the
                        time, so being hungry was reasonable. He added: “I thought it would be interesting … isn’t
                        it taped there to be eaten?”. A valid response, considering presenting a banana to someone
                        but not allowing them to eat it is one of the highest forms of torture a human can
                        experience. </p>

                    <p>BANANA DRAMA CONTINUES: The banana art piece consumption incident continued well into June. In an
                        interview with Anna Derrig, the culprit, or as some (me) may call him, hero, stated: "I wasn’t
                        feeling much at the time, but I remember the taste. One of my tutors later asked if the banana
                        was delicious, and I told him it was fresh, fresher than I thought it would be. I ate it as I
                        would normally eat a banana. Nobody tried to stop me. After I finished, I placed the banana skin
                        under the tape on the wall. Then, a guard said, “excuse me”, but didn’t try to restrain me in
                        any way. I talked to the guards. They looked embarrassed."</p>

                    <p>In a rare event, nine banana trees bloomed at the University of Saskatchewan. Canadians had
                        been devastated by the increased difficulty of acquiring a banana due to inflation, so this
                        miracle may have been a gift to them, perhaps by the banana god. The man growing the trees
                        thinks it may be due to climate change. If that's the case, thank you climate change! </p>

                        bananas and cocaine continue to be tied together. Because of the volume and number of
                        containers used to to transport bananas, they are a great target for cocaine smugglers. Jose
                        Hidalgo, executive director of the Assn. of Banana Exporters of Ecuador (God I want that
                        title) added: “It is because of bananas that there are so many ports... It opens routes to
                        other export products.”</p>

                    <p>A disease called Banana Xanthomas Wilt is on the rise. Researchers have found that if left
                        uncontrolled, the disease could cause a... 55% reduction in banana production within 10
                        years...? No... NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! WHYYYYYYY!!!!!! Oh, however, if the response from governments
                        and farmers is swift, the damage would be almost zero. Let us pray. </p>

                        our holiest of crops? You know what, I give up. I'm switching to Buddhism. Banana Buddhism.
                        Is there such a thing? If not, I'll have to found it. Actually, maybe I'll join the side of
                        science and help with development of the QCAV-4 banana. That might land me a spot in hell,
